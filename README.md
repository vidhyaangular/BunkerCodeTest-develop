# Welcome to the Bunker Code Test
Thanks for your interest in working with use at Bunker! This is a simple code test. The purpose is to let us get an idea of how you do things. The test consists of adding a simple form to an Angular project, submitting it, and displaying a result.

## Tasks
This code test is intended only to take an hour or two at the most. Work through as much of it as you can in a reasonable amount of time, and we'll discuss it during the interview.
- Create a GitHub account, if you don't already have one.
- Fork this repository.
- Clone your fork locally, and **make a branch off of the *develop* branch** to work in.
- Add a component with a form to collect the following data:
    - First Name (string)
    - Last Name (string)
    - Favorite Color (string)
- Write code to submit the data from the form to the *people/add* endpoint of  [this API](https://bunkerdev.portal.azure-api.net/docs/services/59319e778c574311ec995ca4/operations/59319f658c574311ec995ca5). See the API documentation for information on the payload to post and the structure of the response.
- Display the resulting data in the component
- When finished **submit a pull request** back to your repository's develop branch. 
## Prerequisites
- This is an Angular CLI project in TypeScript. It must be able to be built and run with Angular CLI.
- [Angular CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-cli) and its prerequisites (Node 4 or higher, NPM 3 or higher) 
- A **Git** client
- An IDE to work in. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Don't forget to install the NPM packages after cloning the repo.
## Guidelines
- Don't worry. This code test is just one part of how we'll get to know you. We're not going to judge you entirely based on whether you did or did not do a particular thing in this test. We just want a sense of how you work.
- Don't overdo it. This shouldn't take more than a few hours, tops. The task is simple, so the solution should be simple as well. Use good structure and good practices, but it doesn't need to be gold-plated.
- Don't spend a lot of time trying to make the page pretty, we're more interested in pretty code right now.
- If you have questions, first try working them out on your own. Part of what we're looking for is how you solve problems. 
    - If you struggle with something then figure it out **do** make a note of it and tell us about it. We love hearing how people work through things.
    - If you struggle with something and can't figure it out, it's fine to email your contact at Bunker and ask about it - particularly if instructions are incorrect or unclear, or of something is broken
- Have fun. We love writing code, and we hope you do too. Feel free to get creative, if you like.
- Researching things online is encouraged.
